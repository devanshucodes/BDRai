                  ]
          - Testing Practices:
              - Current Methods: [Based on available information (job postings, tech blogs, company website, etc.), what can you infer about their current testing practices? Do they emphasize automation, manual testing, or a mix? What tools or frameworks might they be using? If it's evident they don't engage in software testing, note this.]
              - Potential Challenges: [Based on their industry, size, and current practices, what are some likely testing challenges they might be facing? (e.g., scaling testing, maintaining test infrastructure, achieving continuous testing, ensuring cross-browser/device compatibility).

Be realistic and only suggest LambdaTest's capabilities if they align with the company's likely needs. Highlight relevant features and benefits, such as:
                  - HyperExecute: For faster test execution.
                  - SmartUI: For AI-powered visual regression testing.
                  - 5000+ Browser/OS/Device Combinations: For comprehensive coverage.
                  - Integrations: With their existing CI/CD pipeline or other tools.
                  - KaneAI: For end-to-end testing automation
                  - Cost Savings: Compared to building and maintaining their own infrastructure or using competitor platforms.
                  - If your research indicates that the company is unlikely to need or benefit from LambdaTest's offerings, state that clearly.

      Research Instructions:
      - Conduct a thorough search online, including the company's website, LinkedIn profiles, industry news articles, press releases, tech blogs, job postings, and app store listings. Pay special attention to any information about acquisitions or the company's primary business activities.
      - Analyze their website for information about their tech stack, development methodologies, and quality assurance processes. If the website suggests they don't develop software, make a note of this.
      - Look for any information about their testing practices, challenges, or initiatives.
      - Check for mentions of competitor platforms or tools.
      - Use the information gathered to create a comprehensive profile of the company.
      - **Crucially: Do not hallucinate or assume information. Only provide details that you can find evidence for.**
      - **Do not use any special characters or formatting to highlight text. Provide the information in plain text, following the specified structure.**
      - **Focus on accuracy and verifiable information. If you cannot find specific details, it is better to leave that section blank than to guess.**
      - **Determine if the company is a good fit for LambdaTest based on whether they develop and test software or digital products. If they don't, clearly state that they are not a suitable prospect.**`;
